To the reviewer: 

I originally did this project once and was going to submit that one, but I redid it to make sure I understood the concepts. In doing it the second time, since I already had the last project on GitHub, I didn't create a repository for the new project, thinking the other one was good enough to submit. However, by the end of the project, I changed my mind and decided to create a new repository. That is why there is only a few commits. I thought about uploading the file, but I figured if I need to make any changes from this point forward it would be far easier with a repository.

I wasn't sure if I would get marked down for not having more than 1 commit, so I wanted to explain.
